Some examples include: Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event and last no longer than 6 months after the end of the stressful event.

But sometimes the stressful event remains a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up and you face the same emotional struggles all over again. Talk to your doctor if you continue to struggle or if youre having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again. If you have concerns about your childs adjustment or behavior talk with your childs pediatrician.

Brain aneurysms develop as a result of thinning artery walls. Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those sections of the vessel are weaker. Although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain they are most common in arteries at the base of the brain. An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. A proportion of these patients will go on to have a rupture. And the challenge with rupture is that it\\\\s unpredictable. Dr. Bernard Bendok says a ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain. The typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life. Fast treatment is essential. It includes open surgery or less-invasive options such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils and/or stents. Dr. Bendok says 1 to 2 percent of the population have aneurysms and only a small percentage of that group will experience a rupture. People who have a family history of aneurysms have polycystic kidney disease connective tissue disease and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture and should consider screening.

Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles.

Brain aneurysms develop as a result of thinning artery walls. Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those sections of the vessel are weaker. Although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain they are most common in arteries at the base of the brain. An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. A proportion of these patients will go on to have a rupture. And the challenge with rupture is that it\\\\s unpredictable. Dr. Bernard Bendok says a ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain. The typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life. Fast treatment is essential. It includes open surgery or less-invasive options such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils and/or stents.

People who have a family history of aneurysms have polycystic kidney disease connective tissue disease and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture and should consider screening.

CAS can be associated with: These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years and may indicate suspected CAS. As children produce more speech usually between ages 2 and 4 characteristics that likely indicate CAS include: Many children with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. Many children with CAS also have language problems such as reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. Its difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. Some characteristics sometimes called markers help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and arent helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders phonological disorders and dysarthria. A child who has trouble learning how to make specific sounds but doesnt have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles cant move as far as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse soft or even strained voice or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.

This is known as an adrenal crisis and it can be life-threatening. The salt-losing form and simple-virilizing form of classic CAH cause childrens bodies to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol. These children can have problems maintaining normal blood pressure normal blood sugar and energy levels and are more vulnerable to stress. An excess of the male sex hormones can result in short height and early puberty for both boys and girls. Signs and symptoms of classic CAH in children and adults include: Often there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and usually becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood. Cortisol may be the only hormone thats deficient.

In fact delirium frequently occurs in people with dementia. But having episodes of delirium does not always mean a person has dementia. So a dementia assessment should not be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Dementia is the progressive decline of memory and other thinking skills due to the gradual dysfunction and loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimers disease. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include: If a relative friend or someone in your care shows any signs or symptoms of delirium see a doctor. Your input about the persons symptoms typical thinking and everyday abilities will be important for a proper diagnosis and for finding the underlying cause.

The onset of delirium occurs within a short time while dementia usually begins with relatively minor symptoms that gradually worsen over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain attention is significantly impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Fluctuation. The appearance of delirium symptoms can fluctuate significantly and frequently throughout the day.

Multitasking is especially difficult and it may be challenging to manage finances balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. These difficulties may progress to an inability to recognize and deal with numbers. The ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations will decline. For example a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather. It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations. Once-routine activities that require sequential steps such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game become a struggle as the disease progresses. Eventually people with advanced Alzheimers may forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Brain changes that occur in Alzheimers disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following: Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books telling stories and reminiscing singing listening to music dancing drawing or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease.

The condition usually begins as a thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand. As it progresses the skin on your palm might appear puckered or dimpled. A firm lump of tissue can form on your palm. This lump might be sensitive to the touch but usually isnt painful. In later stages of Dupuytrens contracture cords of tissue form under the skin on your palm and can extend up to your fingers. As these cords tighten your fingers might be pulled toward your palm sometimes severely. The two fingers farthest from the thumb are most commonly affected though the middle finger also can be involved. Only rarely are the thumb and index finger affected. Dupuytrens contracture can occur in both hands though one hand is usually affected more severely.   ']\n",

In fact delirium frequently occurs in people with dementia. But having episodes of delirium does not always mean a person has dementia. So a dementia assessment should not be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Dementia is the progressive decline of memory and other thinking skills due to the gradual dysfunction and loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimers disease. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include: If a relative friend or someone in your care shows any signs or symptoms of delirium see a doctor. Your input about the persons symptoms typical thinking and everyday abilities will be important for a proper diagnosis and for finding the underlying cause. If you notice signs and symptoms of delirium in a person in a hospital or nursing home report your concerns to the nursing staff or doctor rather than assuming that those problems have been observed. Older people recovering in the hospital or living in a long-term care facility are particularly at risk of delirium. An inability to stay focused on a topic or to switch topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions or conversation Being easily distracted by unimportant things Being withdrawn with little or no activity or little response to the environment Poor memory particularly of recent events Disorientation  for example not knowing where you are or who you are Difficulty speaking or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Difficulty reading or writing Seeing things that dont exist (hallucinations) Restlessness agitation or combative behavior Calling out moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn  especially in older adults Slowed movement or lethargy Disturbed sleep habits Reversal of night-day sleep-wake cycle Anxiety fear or paranoia Depression Irritability or anger A sense of feeling elated (euphoria) Apathy Rapid and unpredictable mood shifts Personality changes Hyperactive delirium. Probably the most easily recognized type this may include restlessness (for example pacing) agitation rapid mood changes or hallucinations and refusal to cooperate with care. Hypoactive delirium. This may include inactivity or reduced motor activity sluggishness abnormal drowsiness or seeming to be in a daze. Mixed delirium. This includes both hyperactive and hypoactive signs and symptoms. The person may quickly switch back and forth from hyperactive to hypoactive states. Onset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time while dementia usually begins with relatively minor symptoms that gradually worsen over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain attention is significantly impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Fluctuation. The appearance of delirium symptoms can fluctuate significantly and frequently throughout the day.

People with Alzheimers may: Alzheimers disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Multitasking is especially difficult and it may be challenging to manage finances balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. These difficulties may progress to an inability to recognize and deal with numbers. The ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations will decline. For example a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather. It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations. Once-routine activities that require sequential steps such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game become a struggle as the disease progresses. Eventually people with advanced Alzheimers may forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Brain changes that occur in Alzheimers disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following: Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books telling stories and reminiscing singing listening to music dancing drawing or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease.

Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following: Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head trunk and limbs are all small but theyre proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include: Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent.

Anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa  often simply called anorexia  is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. When you have anorexia you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight such as excessive exercise using laxatives or diet aids or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight even when underweight can cause severe health problems sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa  commonly called bulimia  is a serious potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day which often leads to more binge eating and purging. During these episodes you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods such as laxatives to get rid of the calories. If you have bulimia youre probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. When you have binge-eating disorder you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended even when youre not hungry and you may continue eating even long after youre uncomfortably full. After a binge you may feel guilty disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you dont try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight overweight or obese. Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating but its not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you dont have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics such as color texture smell or taste; or youre concerned about the consequences of eating such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight. The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems. An eating disorder can be difficult to manage or overcome by yourself. Eating disorders can virtually take over your life. If youre experiencing any of these problems or if you think you may have an eating disorder seek medical help. Unfortunately many people with eating disorders may not think they need treatment. If youre worried about a loved one urge him or her to talk to a doctor. Even if your loved one isnt ready to acknowledge having an issue with food you can open the door by expressing concern and a desire to listen. Be alert for eating patterns and beliefs that may signal unhealthy behavior as well as peer pressure that may trigger eating disorders.

Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat.

This disorder usually results in the following: Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head trunk and limbs are all small but theyre proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.

Anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa  often simply called anorexia  is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. When you have anorexia you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight such as excessive exercise using laxatives or diet aids or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight even when underweight can cause severe health problems sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa  commonly called bulimia  is a serious potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day which often leads to more binge eating and purging. During these episodes you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods such as laxatives to get rid of the calories. If you have bulimia youre probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. When you have binge-eating disorder you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended even when youre not hungry and you may continue eating even long after youre uncomfortably full. After a binge you may feel guilty disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you dont try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight overweight or obese. Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating but its not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you dont have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics such as color texture smell or taste; or youre concerned about the consequences of eating such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight. The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems. An eating disorder can be difficult to manage or overcome by yourself. Eating disorders can virtually take over your life. If youre experiencing any of these problems or if you think you may have an eating disorder seek medical help. Unfortunately many people with eating disorders may not think they need treatment. If youre worried about a loved one urge him or her to talk to a doctor. Even if your loved one isnt ready to acknowledge having an issue with food you can open the door by expressing concern and a desire to listen. Be alert for eating patterns and beliefs that may signal unhealthy behavior as well as peer pressure that may trigger eating disorders.

In the type of patchy hair loss known as alopecia areata hair loss occurs suddenly and usually starts with one or more circular bald patches that may overlap.   Hair loss can occur if you wear pigtails braids or cornrows or use tight hair rollers. This is called traction alopecia.   Early treatment of a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia) might help avoid significant permanent baldness. The cause of this condition is unknown but it primarily affects older women.  Hair loss can appear in many different ways depending on whats causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment.

In men hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging.

Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate but can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms include: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas) which can cause hearing loss.

Plexiform neurofibromas when located on the face can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone growth and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma).

This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defects of the heart. The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect) narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis) or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation).

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) usually appears in childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate but can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms include: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas) which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Signs and symptoms generally appear in the late teen and early adult years and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include: Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves of the body including the cranial spinal visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. Signs and symptoms of these schwannomas can include: This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. On average symptoms appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial spinal and peripheral nerves  but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Because tumors dont usually grow on both hearing nerves schwannomatosis doesnt cause the hearing loss experienced by people with NF2. Symptoms of schwannomatosis include: See your doctor if you or your child develops signs or symptoms of neurofibromatosis. The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis are often benign and slow growing. So although its important to obtain a timely diagnosis the situation isnt an emergency. Flat light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots is a strong indication of NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After early childhood new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules cant easily be seen and dont affect vision. Soft pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes a growth will involve multiple nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas when located on the face can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone growth and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3 rarely in late childhood and adolescence and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children with NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also is common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.

The most recognizable form of albinism results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings. Skin coloring (pigmentation) and hair color can range from white to brown and may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. With exposure to the sun some people may develop: For some people with albinism skin pigmentation never changes. For others melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years resulting in slight changes in pigmentation. Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color thats yellow reddish or brown. Hair color may also darken by early adulthood or stain from exposure to normal minerals in water and the environment and appear darker with age. Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. The lack of pigment in the colored part of the eyes (irises) makes the irises somewhat translucent. This means that the irises cant completely block light from entering the eye. Because of this very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision impairment is a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems and issues may include: At your childs birth if the doctor notices a lack of pigment in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows the doctor will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your childs pigmentation and vision. If you observe signs of albinism in your baby talk to your doctor. Contact your doctor if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds easy bruising or chronic infections.

It develops most often in the jaw near the molars and can invade local structures such as bone and soft tissue. This tumor can recur after treatment; however aggressive surgical treatments will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. Some of these tumors can grow rapidly can cause pain and destroy bone and have a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other types are less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. Also referred to as keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment this slow-growing benign cyst can be destructive to local structures. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare slow-growing benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by aggressive surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms but may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor.

Acute pericarditis usually lasts less than three weeks. Incessant pericarditis lasts about four to six weeks but less than three months and is continuous. Pericarditis is described as recurrent if it occurs about four to six weeks after an episode of acute pericarditis with a symptom-free interval in between. Pericarditis is considered chronic if symptoms last longer than three months. If you have acute pericarditis the most common symptom is sharp stabbing chest pain behind the breastbone or in the left side of your chest. However some people with acute pericarditis describe their chest pain as dull achy or pressure-like instead and of varying intensity. The pain of acute pericarditis may travel into your left shoulder and neck. It often intensifies when you cough lie down or inhale deeply. Sitting up and leaning forward can often ease the pain. At times it may be difficult to distinguish pericardial pain from the pain that occurs with a heart attack. Chronic pericarditis is usually associated with chronic inflammation and may result in fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion). The most common symptom of chronic pericarditis is chest pain. Depending on the type signs and symptoms of pericarditis may include some or all of the following: Seek immediate medical care if you develop new symptoms of chest pain. Many of the symptoms of pericarditis are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. The sooner you are evaluated the sooner you can receive proper diagnosis and treatment.

Contact your doctor immediately if signs or symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly or are associated with a severe headache visual disturbances confusion or a drop in blood pressure. These could be signs and symptoms of sudden destruction of the pituitary gland tissue (pituitary apoplexy) often caused by bleeding into the pituitary gland. Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency and requires prompt medical attention.    Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changes Fatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm Severe fatigue Low blood pressure which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea vomiting or abdominal pain Confusion Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances', 'Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that dont make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures. Large pituitary tumors  those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger  are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures. Signs and symptoms of pressure from a pituitary tumor may include: Functioning pituitary tumors cause an overproduction of hormones. Different types of functioning tumors in your pituitary gland cause specific signs and symptoms and sometimes a combination of them. Large tumors could cause hormonal deficiencies. Signs and symptoms include: ACTH tumors produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin which stimulates your adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. Cushings syndrome results from your adrenal glands producing too much cortisol. Possible signs and symptoms of Cushings syndrome include: These tumors produce excess growth hormone (acromegaly) which can cause: Children and adolescents might grow too fast or too tall. Overproduction of prolactin from a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) can cause a decrease in normal levels of sex hormones  estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Excessive prolactin in the blood affects men and women differently. In women prolactinoma might cause: In men a prolactin-producing tumor may cause male hypogonadism. Signs and symptoms can include: When a pituitary tumor overproduces thyroid-stimulating hormone your thyroid gland makes too much of the hormone thyroxine. This is a rare cause of hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your bodys metabolism causing: If you develop signs and symptoms that might be associated with a pituitary tumor see your doctor. Pituitary tumors often can be treated to return your hormone levels to normal and alleviate your signs and symptoms. If you know that multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) runs in your family talk to your doctor about periodic tests that may help detect a pituitary tumor early.

Before the herald patch appears some people experience headache fatigue fever or sore throat. A few days to a few weeks after the herald patch appears you may notice smaller scaly spots across your back chest or abdomen that resemble a pine-tree pattern. The rash can cause itching which is occasionally severe. See your doctor if you develop a persistent rash.   ', 'Newborns with PKU initially dont have any symptoms. However without treatment babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months. PKU signs and symptoms can be mild or severe and may include: The severity of PKU depends on the type. But most children with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If women dont follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing fetus or cause a miscarriage. Even women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet. Babies born to mothers with high phenylalanine levels dont often inherit PKU. But they can have serious consequences if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mothers blood during pregnancy. Complications at birth may include: Seek medical advice in these situations: A musty odor in the breath skin or urine caused by too much phenylalanine in the body Neurological problems that may include seizures Skin rashes (eczema) Fair skin and blue eyes because phenylalanine cant transform into melanin  the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone Abnormally small head (microcephaly) Hyperactivity Intellectual disability Delayed development Behavioral emotional and social problems Psychiatric disorders Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to convert phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced resulting in high levels of phenylalanine and severe brain damage. Less severe forms of PKU. In mild or moderate forms the enzyme retains some function so phenylalanine levels are not as high resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. Low birth weight Delayed development Facial abnormalities Abnormally small head Heart defects and other heart problems Intellectual disability Behavioral problems Newborns. If routine newborn screening tests show that your baby may have PKU your childs doctor will want to start dietary treatment right away to prevent long-term problems. Women of childbearing years. Its especially important for women with a history of PKU to see a doctor and maintain the PKU diet before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies. Adults. People with PKU continue to receive care across the life span. Adults with PKU who have stopped the PKU diet in their teens may benefit from a visit with their doctors. Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and slow damage to the central nervous system that can result from high phenylalanine levels.', 'Placenta accreta often causes no signs or symptoms during pregnancy  although vaginal bleeding during the third trimester might occur. Occasionally placenta accreta is detected during a routine ultrasound.   ', 'Bright red vaginal bleeding without pain during the second half of pregnancy is the main sign of placenta previa. Some women also have contractions. In many women diagnosed with placenta previa early in their pregnancies the placenta previa resolves. As the uterus grows it might increase the distance between the cervix and the placenta. The more the placenta covers the cervix and the later in the pregnancy that it remains over the cervix the less likely it is to resolve. If you have vaginal bleeding during your second or third trimester call your doctor right away. If the bleeding is severe seek emergency medical care.   ', 'Placental abruption is most likely to occur in the last trimester of pregnancy especially in the last few weeks before birth. Signs and symptoms of placental abruption include: Abdominal pain and back pain often begin suddenly. The amount of vaginal bleeding can vary greatly and doesnt necessarily indicate how much of the placenta has separated from the uterus. Its possible for the blood to become trapped inside the uterus so even with a severe placental abruption there might be no visible bleeding. In some cases placental abruption develops slowly (chronic abruption) which can cause light intermittent vaginal bleeding. Your baby might not grow as quickly as expected and you might have low amniotic fluid or other complications. Seek emergency care if you have signs or symptoms of placental abruption.

Chest pain that worsens when you breathe cough or sneeze Shortness of breath  because you are trying to minimize breathing in and out A cough  only in some cases A fever  only in some cases Pleural effusion. In some cases of pleurisy fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue. This is called pleural effusion. When there is a fair amount of fluid pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact and dont rub together. Atelectasis. A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure compressing your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses (atelectasis). This makes breathing difficult and might cause coughing. Empyema. The extra fluid can also become infected resulting in an accumulation of pus. This is called an empyema. An empyema is often accompanied by fever.', 'The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu but they last longer. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection.

In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency the second deficiency may increase or in some cases hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. In children GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency dont have any symptoms but for some adults it can cause: Deficiency of these hormones called gonadotropins affect the reproductive system. In women the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as: Men may also have symptoms such as: This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: This hormone which is also called vasopressin helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus which can cause: Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding. See your doctor if you develop any of the signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism.

Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that dont make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures. Large pituitary tumors  those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger  are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures. Signs and symptoms of pressure from a pituitary tumor may include: Functioning pituitary tumors cause an overproduction of hormones. Different types of functioning tumors in your pituitary gland cause specific signs and symptoms and sometimes a combination of them. Large tumors could cause hormonal deficiencies. Signs and symptoms include: ACTH tumors produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin which stimulates your adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. Cushings syndrome results from your adrenal glands producing too much cortisol. Possible signs and symptoms of Cushings syndrome include: These tumors produce excess growth hormone (acromegaly) which can cause: Children and adolescents might grow too fast or too tall. Overproduction of prolactin from a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) can cause a decrease in normal levels of sex hormones  estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Excessive prolactin in the blood affects men and women differently. In women prolactinoma might cause: In men a prolactin-producing tumor may cause male hypogonadism. Signs and symptoms can include: When a pituitary tumor overproduces thyroid-stimulating hormone your thyroid gland makes too much of the hormone thyroxine. This is a rare cause of hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your bodys metabolism causing: If you develop signs and symptoms that might be associated with a pituitary tumor see your doctor.

Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when theyre held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes a narrowing of the head at the temples a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired respond poorly to stimulation have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females the clitoris and labia may be small. Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food resulting in rapid weight gain starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors such as hoarding food or eating frozen food or even garbage may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs incomplete or delayed puberty and in nearly all cases infertility. Without treatment women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability such as issues with thinking reasoning and problem-solving is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development.

See your childs doctor right away if you begin to notice physical problems or changes in behavior after apparently normal development such as: Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than normal head size (microcephaly) is usually the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older delayed growth in other parts of the body becomes evident. Loss of normal movement and coordination. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk normally. At first this loss of abilities occurs rapidly and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or may become rigid or spastic with abnormal movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes such as a sudden loss of speech. Over time children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Abnormal hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome typically develop repetitive purposeless hand movements that may differ for each person. Hand movements may include hand-wringing squeezing clapping tapping or rubbing. Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements such as intense staring blinking crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath-holding abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation) forceful exhalation of air or saliva and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours but breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or periodic breathing can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly for no apparent reason and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other abnormal behaviors. These may include for example sudden odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter hand licking and grasping of hair or clothing. Cognitive disabilities.

Schizotypal personality disorder can easily be confused with schizophrenia a severe mental illness in which people lose contact with reality (psychosis). While people with schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes with delusions or hallucinations the episodes are not as frequent prolonged or intense as in schizophrenia. Another key distinction is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of the difference between their distorted ideas and reality. Those with schizophrenia generally cant be swayed away from their delusions. Despite the differences people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments similar to those used for schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is sometimes considered to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe. People with schizotypal personality disorder are likely to seek help only at the urging of friends or family members.

Excessive daytime sleepiness usually is the first symptom to appear and is often the most troublesome making it difficult for you to concentrate and fully function. Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition called cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see) can cause a number of physical changes from slurred speech to complete weakness of most muscles and may last up to a few minutes. Cataplexy is uncontrollable and is triggered by intense emotions usually positive ones such as laughter or excitement but sometimes fear surprise or anger. For example when you laugh your head may droop uncontrollably or your knees may suddenly buckle. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year while others have numerous episodes daily. Not everyone with narcolepsy experiences cataplexy. Sleep paralysis.

This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border both of which are melanoma warning signs.   Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare aggressive skin cancer. It appears as a painless flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule growing on your skin.  Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin including the scalp face lips ears neck chest arms and hands and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day  your palms beneath your fingernails or toenails and your genital area. Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones its more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body such as your neck or face.

In people with darker skin tones melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles or under the fingernails or toenails. Melanoma signs include: Other less common types of skin cancer include: Kaposi sarcoma. This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skins blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems such as people with AIDS and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity such as people whove undergone organ transplants. Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage.

Theyre oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter  the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age.

Look for moles with irregular shapes such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular notched or scalloped borders  characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for changes over time such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms such as new itchiness or bleeding. Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet.

Having one type of reaction doesnt mean youll always have the same reaction every time youre stung or that the next reaction will necessarily be more severe. Most of the time bee sting symptoms are minor and include: In most people the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a bit stronger reaction with signs and symptoms such as: Moderate reactions tend to resolve over five to 10 days. Having a moderate reaction doesnt mean youll have a severe allergic reaction the next time youre stung. But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time theyre stung. If this happens to you talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time. A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: People who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they\\\\re stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measures such as immunotherapy (allergy shots) to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again.

The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many.  Syphilis develops in stages and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap and symptoms dont always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis and not notice any symptoms for years. The first sign of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three weeks after exposure. Many people who have syphilis dont notice the chancre because its usually painless and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on its own within three to six weeks. Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body  even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sores in your mouth or genital area.

Signs and symptoms may never return or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who dont get treatment will develop complications known as late (tertiary) syphilis.

Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. These can include: There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: A misshapen head doesnt always indicate craniosynostosis. For example if the back of your babys head appears flattened it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head. This can be treated with regular position changes or if significant with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance. Your doctor will routinely monitor your childs head growth at well-child visits. Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your babys head growth or shape.    A misshapen skull with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your babys skull Development of a raised hard ridge along affected sutures Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal) the head has a short and wide appearance often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of your babys head to appear flat one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.', 'ds': 'Synostosis (See: Synostosis, also known asCraniosynostosis)', 'url': 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/craniosynostosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354513'}, {'text': ' Primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) on your genitals rectum tongue or lips. The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many.  Syphilis develops in stages and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap and symptoms dont always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis and not notice any symptoms for years. The first sign of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three weeks after exposure. Many people who have syphilis dont notice the chancre because its usually painless and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on its own within three to six weeks. Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body  even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sores in your mouth or genital area. Some people also experience hair loss muscle aches a fever a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms may disappear within a few weeks or repeatedly come and go for as long as a year. If you arent treated for syphilis the disease moves from the secondary stage to the hidden (latent) stage when you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Signs and symptoms may never return or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who dont get treatment will develop complications known as late (tertiary) syphilis. In the late stage the disease may damage your brain nerves eyes heart blood vessels liver bones and joints. These problems may occur many years after the original untreated infection. At any stage syphilis can spread and among other damage cause damage to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis) and the eye (ocular syphilis). Babies born to women who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth. Most newborns with congenital syphilis have no symptoms although some experience a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Later signs and symptoms may include deafness teeth deformities and saddle nose  where the bridge of the nose collapses. However babies born with syphilis can also be born too early be born dead (stillborn) or die after birth. Call your doctor if you or your child experiences any unusual discharge sore or rash  particularly if it occurs in the groin area. Vivien Williams: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Dr. Stacey Rizza an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic says syphilis affects men and women and can present in various stages. Stacey Rizza M.D.: Primary syphilis causes an ulcer and this sometimes isnt noticed because its painless and can be inside the vagina or on the cervixafter a few weeks two months they can get secondary syphilis which is a rash. Vivien Williams: It may then progress to latent stage syphilis and finally the most serious stage: tertiary. Pregnant women are not immune to syphilis. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage stillbirth or infant deaths. Thats why all pregnant women should be screened. Syphilis is preventable and treatable. As for prevention Dr. Rizza recommends barrier protection during sex. Dr. Rizza: And thats during oral sex anal sex vaginal sex  using condoms dental dams and any other barrier protection.

Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the last couple of months of normal fetal development the testicles gradually descend from the abdomen through a tube-like passageway in the groin (inguinal canal) into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle that process stops or is delayed. An undescended testicle is typically detected when your baby is examined shortly after birth. If your son has an undescended testicle ask the doctor how often your son will need to be examined. If the testicle hasnt moved into the scrotum by the time your son is 4 months old the problem probably wont correct itself. Treating an undescended testicle when your son is still a baby might lower the risk of complications later in life such as infertility and testicular cancer. Older boys  from infants to pre-adolescent boys  who have normally descended testicles at birth might appear to be missing a testicle later.

When people with lung cavities are also infected with aspergillus fungus fibers may find their way into the cavities and grow into tangled masses (fungus balls) known as aspergillomas. Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment however aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause: This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to the brain heart kidneys or skin. Invasive aspergillosis occurs only in people whose immune systems are weakened as a result of cancer chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation or a disease of the immune system. Untreated this form of aspergillosis may be fatal. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected but in general invasive aspergillosis can cause: Aspergillus can invade areas of your body other than your lungs such as your sinuses. In your sinuses the fungus can cause a stuffy nose sometimes accompanied by drainage that may contain blood. Fever facial pain and headache may also occur. If you have asthma or cystic fibrosis see your doctor whenever you notice a change in your breathing. Although aspergillosis may not be the cause its important to have breathing problems evaluated. If you have a weakened immune system and develop an unexplained fever shortness of breath or a cough that brings up blood get immediate medical care. In the case of invasive aspergillosis prompt treatment is crucial. In some cases treatment with antifungal medication begins as soon as aspergillosis is suspected even before testing has confirmed the diagnosis.

As children produce more speech usually between ages 2 and 4 characteristics that likely indicate CAS include: Many children with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. Many children with CAS also have language problems such as reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. Its difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. Some characteristics sometimes called markers help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and arent helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders phonological disorders and dysarthria.

Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS.

Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles cant move as far as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse soft or even strained voice or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.

Even in areas where it exists youre not likely to become infected if you follow food safety recommendations. Still cases of cholera occur throughout the world. If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera see your doctor. If you have diarrhea especially severe diarrhea and think you might have been exposed to cholera seek treatment right away. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate care. Diarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss  as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours. Dehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration.\\\\nSigns and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability fatigue sunken eyes a dry mouth extreme thirst dry and shriveled skin thats slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold little or no urinating low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.\\\\n Muscle cramps. These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium chloride and potassium. Shock. This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes.', 'ds': 'Cholera', 'url': 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholera/symptoms-causes/syc-20355287'}]\n",

If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend talk about your concerns and ask about going together to a doctors appointment.

              "'Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include among others: Sometimes its difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or angst from signs of drug use. Possible indications that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include: Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary depending on the type of drug. Below youll find several examples. People use cannabis by smoking eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances such as alcohol or illegal drugs and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Long-term (chronic) use is often associated with: Two groups of synthetic drugs  synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones  are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids also called K2 or Spice are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked but can be prepared as an herbal tea. Despite manufacturer claims these are chemical compounds rather than natural or harmless products. These drugs can produce a high similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Substituted cathinones also called bath salts are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten snorted inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Barbiturates benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They\\\\re often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to switch off or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Stimulants include amphetamines meth (methamphetamine) cocaine methylphenidate (Ritalin Concerta others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall Adderall XR others). They are often used and misused in search of a high or to boost energy to improve performance at work or school or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Club drugs are commonly used at clubs concerts and parties. Examples include ecstasy or molly (MDMA) gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) flunitrazepam (Rohypnol ? a brand used outside the U.S. ? also called roofie) and ketamine. These drugs are not all in the same category but they share some similar effects and dangers including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation muscle relaxation confusion and memory loss the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include: Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: PCP use may cause: Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue paint thinners correction fluid felt tip marker fluid gasoline cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include: Opioids are narcotic painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes among others heroin morphine codeine methadone and oxycodone. Sometimes called the opioid epidemic addiction to opioid prescription pain medications has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who\\\\ve been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment.  Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include: If your drug use is out of control or causing problems get help. The sooner you seek help the greater your chances for a long-term recovery. Talk with your primary doctor or see a mental health professional such as a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Make an appointment to see a doctor if: If youre not ready to approach a doctor help lines or hotlines may be a good place to learn about treatment. You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book. Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and: People struggling with addiction usually deny that their drug use is problematic and are reluctant to seek treatment. An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and can motivate someone to seek or accept help. An intervention should be carefully planned and may be done by family and friends in consultation with a doctor or professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor or directed by an intervention professional. It involves family and friends and sometimes co-workers clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction. During the intervention these people gather together to have a direct heart-to-heart conversation with the person about the consequences of addiction and ask him or her to accept treatment.
